Stat 290 Winter 2014 repository for presented materials

-----

To add a new chapter, use the command
    \newchapter{<Name of Chapter>}{<Date>}
With your appropriate content between the curly braces. Add your Tex code following that and your chapter will be automatically added to the table of contents. 

It is recommended that this TeX repository serves as a collection of completed presentation files, not an in-progress TeX file for a given week's talk (because of the multiple user setup)

Don't hesitate to ask Jeremy any questions and most importantly, Enjoy!!
